  <p>This site acts as a very brief introduction to me. I've recently completely rebuilt it, as since I became a father I haven't had much time to add new content and after looking at it for the first time in two years, I realised it was horribly old. If you've come here following a link looking for a particular article; bad news, it's gone! The internet is full of really useful resources and I didn't want to add any content that could make things more difficult for people. Therefore anything that goes against the best practices of today has been removed. I'm slowly going through the old content and will be bringing some of it up to date and republishing it. But anything that's truely out of date and either not relevant or not the way things should be done has been deleted forever!</p>
  <p>I've stated with the site structure itsself. I'm going back to basics, partly to avoid "Framework Hell" and the need to update the site every couple of months to show I know the latest version of <em>*insert cool framework here*</em> and partly because at work I rarely get the opportunity any more to focus on the the fundamentals. So take some time and browse through my most recent, or at least most up to date work.</p>
  <p>Thanks,</p>
  <p>Geraint</p>
