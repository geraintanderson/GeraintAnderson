<h1>Bootstrap templates for Angular.js</h1>

  <p>Twitter bootstrap was a huge step forward in responsive design.  Suddenly developers and designers could quickly and easily make good looking web pages that would work on any device.  Plugging Angular.js into Bootstrap pages is normally pretty straightforward but some of the advanced UI isn't always easy. Luckily the <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/">AngularUI team</a> have Angularified many of the bootstrap componens.  In this article I'm going to use the <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/modal">modal</a> to create a UI to add users to a user group.  You can <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/brE1P1yO1YyCq2fxiF5H?p=preview">see the Plunk here</a>.</p>
    <h2>The bare minimum</h2>
    <p>The requirements are listed on the <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/">Angular UI</a> page.  For the full functionality you need to include the angular.js file, angular-animate, angular-touch and the bootstrap CSS.  Then you will need to define an application.</p>
    <pre>var app = angular.module('userGroupApp', ['ui.bootstrap']);</pre>
		<h2>Setting Up the Users Group</h2>
		<p>The whole point of this application is to add users to a group.  So first we need to set up that group.  We will make it on the $scope, which means we need to pass in $scope to the controller.  The group of users is going to be a simple array.</p>
		<pre>
var app = angular.module('userGroup', ['ui.bootstrap']);

app.controller('MainController', ['$scope', function($scope){
  $scope.userGroup = ['Adam', 'Barry', 'Clive'];
}]);
		</pre>
		<p>The we add some UI to show the group.</p>
		<pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li ng-repeat="user in userGroup"&gt;{{user}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
		</pre>
    <h2>Creating the modal markup</h2>
    <p>The modal consists of a header (containing the title), the body for the main content and the footer which normally contains the controlls like the close or save button.  This can be stored in a separate file to keep the code organized.</p>
    <pre>
&lt;div class="modal-header"&gt;
  &lt;h3 class="modal-title"&gt;New Users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="modal-body"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Add new users to the group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="modal-footer"&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn btn-primary" type="button"&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn btn-warning" type="button"&gt;Cancel&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		</pre>
    <h2>Opening and closing the modal</h2>
    <p>At this point we have some code for a modal, but it's not displayed by default.  The controller we use on the page needs access to $uibModal which has an <em>open</em> method used for opening the modal.  In this example I'm creating a method on the $scope to call $uibModal.open().  This is called straight away to test it.</p>
		<pre>
var app = angular.module('userGroup', ['ui.bootstrap']);

app.controller('MainController', ['$scope','$uibModal', function($scope, $uibModal){
  $scope.open = function() {
    var modalInstance = $uibModal.open({
      templateUrl: 'add_user.html'
    });
  };

  $scope.open();
}]);
		</pre>
		<p>The open method should be called by a button so it can be opened on demand.  $uibModal takes some options.  The templateUrl is used to specify the modal content but there are <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/modal">numerous other options</a> which we will go through later.</p>
		<h2>Controller on the Modal</h2>
		<p>It's good practice to create a separate controller for the modal.  This can then be specified in the modal option.</p>
		<pre>
$scope.open = function() {
	var modalInstance = $uibModal.open({
		templateUrl: 'add_user.html',
		controller: 'ModalController'
	});
};
		</pre>
		<p>Now we are able to wire up the buttons.  Use the ng-click functions to call functions on the modal's $scope.  These functions can use the $uibModalInstance to close the modal using the close or dismiss methods.  They both perform similar actions, but with different completion statuses.</p>
		<pre>
app.controller('ModalController', ['$scope', '$uibModalInstance', function($scope, $uibModalInstance){

  $scope.save = function() {
    $uibModalInstance.close();
  };

  $scope.cancel = function() {
    $uibModalInstance.dismiss();
  };
}]);
		</pre>
		<h2>Viewing Existing Users in the Modal</h2>
		<p>At the moment the users are on the $scope of the MainController, but we want to see them in the scope of the Modal.  Using the modal options we can specify a scope.</p>
		<pre>scope: $scope</pre>
		<p>Now that we have access to the correct $scope, we can use a simple ng-repeat directive to loop through the list of users.  Luckily, this is the same as the one we use on the main page.</p>
		<h2>Adding New Users</h2>
		<p>To add a new user there are a couple more changes we need to make.  First, we need somewhere to actually enter the username.  Then we need to pass this data back to the model if the modal is closed with the "ok" button.  If it's cancelled we want to discard the changes without passing them back.</p>
		<p>Let's start by adding a text input to the modal.</p>
		<pre>
&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;User Name&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" ng-model="newUser" &gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		</pre>
		<p>And a button to add this user to the group</p>
		<!-- GOT THIS FAR - Now I need to add the user to the list in the modal, and on exit use the modal result to append it to the userGroup on $scope. -->
		<pre>&lt;button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" ng-click="add()"&gt;Add User&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
		<p>You can type a name into the text input, but it wont be added to the group yet.  We need to configure the add() method to append the new user to the userGroup array.  It's important it's only added to the modal's scope at this stage so we can still cancel the action without affecting the user group on the main controllers scope, encase we change our mind before saving the changes.  If you were to just push the new user to $scope.userGroup you would be adding this user to userGroup in both controllers, because of the shared $scope.  So we need to make a copy of the userGroup array in the modal scope, rather than just using the same one from the MainController scope.  I'll call it modalUserGroup, and I'll need to change the list of users in the modal HTML to display this one, not userGroup.</p>
		<pre>
$scope.modalUserGroup = angular.copy($scope.userGroup);
$scope.add = function(){
  $scope.modalUserGroup.push($scope.newUser);
};
		</pre>
		<p>Now you can add users, and they will show up in the modal.  But closing the modal will lose the changes so they won't show up in the main view.  The last step is to copy the modalUserGroup over the userGroup when the save function is called.  We have already defined our save method on the modal scope.  The $uibModalInstance service lets us pass parameters back to the original controller as a result, so we're going to pass back the modalUserGroup.  Here's the save function in the modal controller.</p>
		<pre>
$scope.save = function() {
  $uibModalInstance.close($scope.modalUserGroup);
};
		</pre>
		<p>And here's the open function in the main controller.</p>
		<pre>
$scope.open = function() {
  var modalInstance = $uibModal.open({
    templateUrl: 'add_user.html',
    controller: 'ModalController',
    scope: $scope
  });

  modalInstance.result.then(function(res){
    $scope.userGroup = res;
  });
};

$scope.open();
console.log($scope);
		</pre>
		<p>This post covered the absolute basics of using the Angular UI bootstrap modal.  When I get chance I'll write about some of the other considerations when creating a modal in this way, including different return options, the scope, resolving variables and some UI improvements.  I'll improve this application by adding in a feature to delete users.</p>

		<h3>Deleting Users</h3>
		<p>Deleting the users is similar to adding new ones, in that we want to take a copy of the list of all the users, modify it and only save it to the main scope when we're happy with it.  The differene is that now we need to know which one we are removing, whereas before we were just adding to the end.  First, let's update the ui to give us the option to delete users by adding a button in the ng-repeat.  We're going to call delete with this button, passing in the index of the repeat so we know which button we clicked.</p>
		<pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li ng-repeat="user in modalUserGroup"&gt;{{user}} &lt;button class="btn btn-danger btn-xs" ng-click="delete($index)"&gt;X&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
		</pre>
		<p>Next, we need to create the delete method to remove users from the modalUserGroup array.  As the save function is already set up to automatically update the user group on the scope we don't need to do anything else here.</p>
		<pre>
$scope.delete = function(userIndex){
	$scope.modalUserGroup.splice(userIndex, 1);
};
		</pre>
