  <p>I'm the lead developer at <a href="http://www.gb3.co.uk">GB3</a>, specialising in full stack JavaScript development. My main focus focus is finding innovative ways to solve hard problems with technology. I pu a particular emphasis on designing and implementing intuitive and robust solutions.</p>

  <p>I enjoy keeping up to date and learning new things and have been fortunate in my career that I have had the opportunity to experiment with new technologies and use the right tools for the job. I push myself to take on new challenges and regularly work on the edge of, or outside of my comfort zone. This has given me the skills to adapt quickly to new situations and to learn quickl on the job.</p>

  <p>I particularly like building products. At GB3 I've built a suite of products that are used in a range of situations from safeguarding to incident management during crisis. Building products has been a focus through my career, and even before. For my <abbr title="Master of Philosophy">MPhil</abbr> at an explosion research company, I built a flame detector that could be used to measure flame speeds during gas explosions. The aim was to create a more accurate measurement device that could be used for testing gas process equipment in a range of scenarios from slow deflagrations to detonations and could be commercialised by <a href="http://www.abershock.com/">Aber Shock</a>, the company that sponsored me. This was also my first experience of iterative design, although then the feedback loop was days! Even so, the methodical approach is very similar to the approach I take in development an I learned a lot about building a new product.</p>

  <p>After finishing my post-grad degree I joined the graduate scheme at <a href="https://www.centrica.com/">Centrica</a>. There was a heavy focus on building managerial and leadership skills. Although I've ended up going down the technical route, I learned a lot of valuable lessons in dealing with people and got to work as the lead through big changes in the company working in multi-national teams. While there, I was the graduate representative. I put a lot of effort into organising knowledge share sessions and arranged regular sessions with the senior leadership team which was an excellent opportunity to learn from them as well as organising speakers! This has always been a big focus of mine and I have arranged countless knowledge shares and lunch and learns since then. At GB3 the permanent team is very small but we share an office with another company so I have organised shared tech talks with them so both companies can grow together.</p>

  <p>I'm now looking for a new challenge; a bigger permanent team of cross-functional developers working with cutting edge technology to build a world leading product. I want to mentor keen developers and help them reach the next rung on their career ladder. I'll be responsible for growing the skills of the team so we can confidently take on the big challenges. The team should be using <abbr title="Test Driven Development">TDD</abbr>/<abbr title="Behavious Driven Development">BDD</abbr> and <abbr title="Continuous Integration and Deployment">CICD</abbr> to automate the mundane tasks that will free up time to work on the diffcult problems. I also want to work at a socially responsible organisation, one that I can share their vision of the future and that really makes a difference.</p>

  <p>Outside work, I enjoy adventures. I'm a keen kayaker and have lead expeditions around the world. At university I lead trips to the Austrian, Swiss and French Alps, Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. While I was president of the kayak club, the club grew significantly to the largest sports club at the university (impressive considering kayaking is a long way from being a mainstream sport). Since then, highlights include being part of the first British kayak expedition to Madagascar where we were the first people to paddle down rivers deep in the jungle, and a 6 week trip to Norway where we paddled some of the hardest European whitewater. I have coached at national events and assessed people for national governing body awards. Over the years I have taught hundereds, if not thousands of people to kayak.</p>

  <p>Much like at work, I like a challenge and have set myself interesting and unusual ones. This has led to me being able to do a lot of different things including juggling, swinging fire poi and playing the ukulele (which I used to play in a pub). Some of these were fun to learn but I havent carried on with them, and others have become hobbies too such as mountain biking and kite boarding.</p>

  <p>I'm a husband and father to a 1 year old so my adventures this last year have been a different sort. I love watching him grow, figuring things out for himself and changing every day. And perhaps when he is a little bigger he will be leading me on expeditions.</p>
