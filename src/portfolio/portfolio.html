  I intend to showcase finished applications that I have built. Due to the nature of the work I have done, I'm not able to show them all, but I will add to this as projects permit.

      <p>While working at <a href="http://www.gb3.co.uk">GB3</a> I designed and built a safeguarding application. I built the application as a full stack JavaScript application using AngularJS, Express and MySQL.</p>
      <a href="http://palysade.co.uk/">http://palysade.co.uk/</a>
      <p>This is used at a large dioceses in England and we received excellent feedback from the customers. My intention was to create an application that's easy to use becuase many of the people who work in safeguarding are not very tech savvy. Using a relational database fitted the data model well where people can navigate the application in many different ways leading to an intuitive user experience.</p>
      <p>I built this in a way that would allow other customers to sign up with minimal re-work allowing it to be re-branded and used for other customers.</p>
