<h3>Users</h3>
<p>Users interact with CRM using the Web Client UI.  Users include system administrators, business...  Web Client UI bundles the functionality for a business role.</p>
<h3>Business Roles</h3>
<p>Business Roles are roles in the organisation and include IC-AGENT and IC-UTIL</p>

<h3>Interaction Centre</h3>

<h4>Roles</h4>
<p>AGENT, MANAGER</p>
<p>The interaction centre supports 3 channels:</p>
<p>Telephone: the customer dials the exchange.  The interaction centre forwards the call to an agent's computer and soft phone and can do things like pull the customers details up for that phone number</p>
<p>Email: the customer emails the mail server.  The interaction centre then just dumps the email into an agent mailbox in the one to one email scenario.  Or ERMS (Email Response Management System) applies rules and does not need agents to work on the emails.</p>
<p>Chat</p>
